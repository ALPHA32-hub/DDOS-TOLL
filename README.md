In this project i have developed a DDoS Attack Tool. My DDoS attack Tool can perform the following attacks: <br/>
  ⦁	Ping of Death<br/>
  ⦁	SNMP Amplification<br/>
  ⦁	UDP Flood<br/>
  ⦁	HTTP Flood<br/>
  ⦁	Slowloris<br/>

In order to do this project i have used some open source tools for each of the attacks.
